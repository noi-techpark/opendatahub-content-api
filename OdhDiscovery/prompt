we are about to create a discovery web application to let users, developers and maintainers to browse the data contained in my data sharing platform. before diving into that we need to create some meaningful context.
we have 2 different services: content and timeseries. content handles and serves static / medatadata about the entries, timeseries handles and serves timeseriese which are linked to contet entries.
the first task i assign you is to analyze content swagger, analyzing all endpoints and parameters. you then are tasked in the creation of an LLM readible document explaining each endpoint parameters, utility and response format, how
 to use rawfilters, what are select clause doing. the deliverable is a document we can use later to build api calls when developing the discovery web app.

i will provide you the swaggers diveided by entity in @OdhDiscovery/context/content_swaggers/*.json use them to perform calls against the correct server.

To better undertand how to use the apis i provide you with some documentation @OdhDiscovery/context/content_rawsort_rawfilter.md @OdhDiscovery/context/content_field_selection.md 
@OdhDiscovery/context/content_geosorting_locationfilter.md . You have to read and understand these files before analyzing the swaggers and i want the deliverable file to contains these notions (rewritten to be more LLM friendly) as 
well.

- Only analyze read operationa
- Use local swagger for Sensors
- Use the other Swagger for all other endpoints
- Read/analyze/understand the existing documentation (md files)
- Deliver an LLM ready file containing instructions on how to use rawfilters,sort,geofilter,selection, ... and the endpoint analysis results (parameters, endpoint, result strcture)
- Deliverable is called "CONTEXT_CONTENT.md" in in @OdhDiscovery/

DO NOT RUN A SUPERFICIAL ANALYSIS, THIS FILE WILL BE USED AS FUNDATION TO BUILD THE WE APPLICATION

the first task i assign you is to read 2 swaggers, keep inly read endpoints, and output one swagger per tag/entity (swagegr section) to make them more readible and chunked.
keep the server url in each output swagger since they refer to different servers. 
@OdhDiscovery/context/content_swagger_local.json must be used ONLY for "sensor" endpoints.
@OdhDiscovery/context/content_swagger.json must be used for all other endpoints.

output swaggers in @OdhDiscovery/context/swaggers/

You are tasked with creating the web app following the below requirements:

- Vue3

- Composition api

api references:
@OdhDiscovery/CONTEXT_CONTENT.md
@OdhDiscovery/CONTEXT_TIMESERIES.md

requisites:
As a person approaching the open data hub trying to undestand what it does and if it fits my needs i want:

- Be able to browser the concept of dataset
What does the dataset describes
How big is the dataset
How complete is the dataset
How the data structure looks like
How complete are fields in the dataset (pct)
How is the format of each field (examples)
How to retrive the dataset from api call
Are there timeseries attached to the dataset?
What timeseries are attached to the dataset?
What is the probability of each timeseries to be attached to an entry?

- Inspect the dataset(s)
Get a tableview of the entries of the dataset calling the api
Button to switch to raw view (formatted collapsible searchable json response)
Still visualize aggregated information of the dataset:
    How the data structure looks like
    How complete are fields in the dataset (pct)
    How is the format of each field (examples)
    Are there timeseries attached to the dataset?
    What timeseries are attached to the dataset?
    What is the probability of each timeseries to be attached to an entry?
Filter data using 2 different approaches:
    The presence (not null) of each property of the dataset (including mapping and dynamic and timeseries)
    Normal filter about property values
Every time a filter is applied the grid/raw json updates and the composed api request is still shown (curl) on top for reprudicibility.
Every time a filter is applied the aggregated information of the dataset are updated using the filtered results.
Button to open "Bulk inspect for timeseries(s)" page with all filtered entries

- Be able to browse the concept of timeseries
what datatypes are avaliable
What do them represent
How many sensors have this timeseries
what is the value type (number, string, geometry, ...)
what are the distinct entity types (datasets) implementing the timeseries
what percentage of entries of each entity type (datset) implement the timeseries

- Inspect the timeseries(s)
Get a tableview of entries implementing the timeseries
get a tableview of entity types (datasets) implementing the timeseries
filter over them

- Bulk inspect for timeseries(s)
Once selected some entries (might them be filtered by "Inspect the dataset(s)" page or "Inspect the timeseries(s)") i want to see al selectable (multiselect) timeseries types.
Selecting the timeseries types the timeseries gets loaded for all entries.
I can unselect some entries.
data is displayed depending on the type but simultaneously for all entries.
display table tab:
    all measurements are displayed as table, all together regardless the type
display raw tab:
    response is displayed as formatted collapsible searchable json response
display formatted tab:
    numeric timeseries 
        are plotted in a chart.
        can switch to table
    string timeseries
        table
    boolean timeseries
        table
    geoshape/geoposition:
        map witht the shole timeseries
        can switch to "instant" view witha  slider where only the measurement at that time is shown on the map
    json timeseries
        are plotted as rable containing the jsons
        can switch to detailed view
            in detailed view the list of distinct keys is shown and by selecting them the section expands replicating the root visualizion (reference to "display formatted tab:" section)
            detailed view is basically a "display formatted tab" inside the json timeseries section (display formatted tab in display formatted tab).

read @WEBAPP_DOCUMENTATION.md . now that you know how the application works i want you to help planning the next steps.
  i woud like to create a chatbot integrated in the webapp.
  the chatbot shoult be able to anwser user question about the timeseries and datasets by performin live ondemand analysis using the same endpoints and logic used by the webapp, basically making the work of
  analyze the webapp result in behalf of the user.
  additionally i woult like the bot to navigate, when needed or appriopriate, the web app to the right page with the right url configuration, to justify and show the user the results (or from what he got) the
  results.
  i am not experienced in chatbot and agents built with langchain or langgraph. i expect i should have a bit of vector dabase to store contextual or static informations, but other than that i don't know what kind
  of reasoning flow, tools to create and how to properly integrate the bot backand with the frontend so that it can "control" the web app.
  i'm also very concerned about the length of the api responses, i think we should foresee some tools to filter, aggreagate and handle very long api response to avoid contxt exhaustion or high costs; are there best-practices, packages or approacesh to adopt?

  can you make a detailed and appriopriate plan on the design, architecture, stack and implementataion of this bot?


  -------------
  content api has an endpoint containing information about datasets. it also contain the path, query params and other data about how to build the url to get the entries of the datasets. basically is a blueprint for datasets.
  the url is content_host/v1?pagenumber=1&removenullvalues=true where the host is https://tourism.opendatahub.com.
  you have to anlyze all entries of the medata to undestand the structure and then you have to build a query builder in the webapp so that we can populate Dataset page with real datasets. Metadata dataset must be included as well and you must hardcode Sensor since it is not registered. modify @OdhDiscovery/webapp/src/api/contentApi.js where datasets were hardcoded.
  the behavuoir must be that the DatasetPage calls metadataapi to get all datasets plus sensors plus metadata. @OdhDiscovery/webapp/src/views/DatasetInspector.vue must look at url path to get the metadata searching for Shortnameand build the url to get entries using that as key. every time the page loads you have to get the metadata from metadataapi to build the api url.
  the result looks like:
